<h1>How it Works</h1>

<p>The project uses a computer, a browser page with some JavaScript, and a Makey Makey board in combination with beading wire, electrical wire, a physical painted canvas, paper and a desk easel. The beading wire on the front of the canvas connects to wires on the back to the Makey Makey board and then the computer. Holding the ground connected to the board the user then completes the circuit to enter input into the browser. The browser listens for the input and plays a victory sound if the player presses the keys in the correct order. The page is currently hosted at http://peatm.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/techStudio/.</p>
<p>Each symbol in the solution is attached to a different part of the Makey Makey board. They use the connections for the board for WASDFG. All of the other symbols are wired together and then to the Makey Makey board’s space entry part. The “mystical artifact” that the player must guide is attached to the ground.</p>
<p>The JavaScript on the page takes every input from the map interface and stores them in an array. The array holds up to six values. Whenever a new value is added, it removes the oldest entry of the six and checks to see if the last entered six values matches the expected or correct entry. If this is the case the browser plays victory music.</p>

<h1>Tutorial</h1>
<h3>You Need:</h3>
<ul>
<li>a computer with a browser, a USB port, and speakers</li>
<li>a Makey Makey board</li>
<li>electrical wire (insulated)</li>
<li>alligator clips (I used 8)</li>
<li>decorative (but conductive) wire, such as beading wire</li>
<li>a stretched canvas</li>
<li>paint (I used acrylic)</li>
<li>paper</li>
<li>black tea (I used an orange pekoe teabag)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step One - Puzzle Design</h3>
<ol>
<li>Design symbols</li>
<li>Pick a six symbol answer</li>
<li>Design map (be careful to avoid getting too close to the edges of the map)</li>
<li>Paint/print puzzle</li>
<li>Create aged paper for the puzzle hints or story by rubbing a used teabag on some paper and tearing the edges</li> 
<li>Since mosts pens are water soluble I recommend writing the hints after the paper finishes drying</li>
</ol>
